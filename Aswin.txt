25th May: After Stand-up

You are doing well. The problem I found is you are not using complete sentences. Instead of saying just the points, you can connect them, and present it in a more descriptive or interactive way. To improve that you can prepare a script before stand-up and go through the script more than once. Also you can use Google translate to improve the grammar and sentence structure. 

25th May: After Demo

I think you prepared well for the demo. That's good. You can reduce the speed of talking so that everyone can clearly hear what is your point. The pronunciation will also get improved when you start talking at minimum speed and focusing on each word. I have noticed a list of "SO". You can avoid it in many places. And try to keep flow while speaking. That's it.

26th May: Stand-up

Good works from your side, focus more on making complete sentences.

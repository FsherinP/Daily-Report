25th May: After stand-up

You are having breakings during speaking and accent problems. I am suggesting a way to overcome these two problems is to use google translate. There write down the script you are going to present and at the right-hand side use Malayalam. go through the meaning and change accordingly.  Then read the script more than once and be confident with the accent. Eventually you will find how to write and how to speak without breaking. Be confident and keep going !!

25th May: After Demo

For the demo, you improved slightly, the speed of speaking is correct. You are telling something but due to network issues it is breaking. I think, you didn't prepare the script before the demo. If it is true, try to prepare it for the upcoming stand-ups and demo. Because it gives confidence and you can avoid breaking. While you are talking,  give importance to make a complete sentence. You should practice on the accent.

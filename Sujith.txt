25th May: After Stand-up

You are doing well. The problem I found is you are not using the complete sentence. To improve more, you can prepare a script before the stand-up and go through the script more than once. Increase your voice a little more. And speak with confidence.

25th May: After Demo

I think you have prepared a script. That's good. But while presenting, you should mimic like you are not reading a passage. To achieve that, you can reduce the speed, add some pause. Primarily you can reduce the speed. That's it.

26th May: Stand-up

Going well. Focus on the speed, loudness, and try to make complete sentences.
